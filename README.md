Database Setup:

Before creating any modules, set up your database. Define the database schema and tables necessary to store data related to students, teachers, courses, grades, and other entities.
User Authentication and Authorization:

Implement user registration, login, and role-based access control. This will ensure that only authorized users can interact with your system.
Settings and Configuration:

Configure basic system settings, such as academic years, grading systems, and school information. These settings can be vital for other modules to function correctly.
Student and Teacher Management:

Create modules for managing student and teacher information. These modules should allow you to add, update, and delete records for students and teachers.
Course Management:

Implement course management functionality. This module should enable you to define courses, assign teachers to courses, and set up course schedules.
Grade Management:

Build the grade management module to record and manage student grades for each course. Consider integrating this module with the student and course modules.
Attendance Management:

Create the attendance management module to record and track student and teacher attendance. You can use this information for generating attendance reports.
Timetable Management:

Develop the timetable management module to create and manage class timetables. Ensure there are no schedule conflicts.
Notification Module:

Implement the notification module to send announcements and notifications to students and teachers. This module can be integrated into other modules for alerts and reminders.
Library Management and Fees/Finance:

Depending on your project's priorities, you can work on the library management module and the fees and finance module. These modules are important but may not be as time-sensitive as others.
Report Generation and Analytics:

Develop modules for generating various types of reports and providing analytics on school performance, attendance, and more.
Security and Audit Trail:

Implement security measures to protect sensitive data and maintain an audit trail of important actions within the system.
API Integration (Optional):

If your project requires integration with external systems or services, work on this module as needed.
Dashboard (Optional):

If you plan to provide a dashboard for users to monitor and manage various aspects of the system, create this module.
Data Backup and Recovery (Optional):

Implement data backup and restore functionality to ensure data integrity.
